/**
 *  https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language/object
 *  
 *  Objects are composed of contiguous sequences of one or more bytes, each byte consisting of CHAR_BIT bits.
 *  CHAR_BIT is platform-dependent (although the most common value is 8)
 * 
 *  Note: to avoid ambiguity, C99 introduces the types int8_t, int16_t, int32_t, and int64_t, 
 *  all have the size (in bits) indicated by their names
 *  
 *  As the language spec establishes that the size of a char is always 1 byte, any object can be represented as
 *  the array char[n], where n is the size of the object.
 * 
 *  Notes: 
 *  - if an object representation does not represent any value of the object type, it is known as trap representation
 *  - when objects of integer types occupy multiple bytes, the use of those bytes is implementation-defined, but the 
 *  two dominant implementations are big-endian and little-endian
 * 
 * 
 * Object representation is also determined by the alignment requirement of each object type. The alignment requirement is a
 * non-negative power of two that represents the number of bytes between successive addresses at which objects of a type
 * can be allocated. Alignment requirements maximise the chances of the CPU fetching the data with one single access to memory
 * as the data will be contained in one word.
 * 
 * In order to satisfy alignment requirements of all members of a struct, padding may be inserted after some of its members
 * Here's the alignment requirements for structs:
 * - data structures are maximally aligned. That is, the address of any instance of a structure (including one in an array) 
 * will be divisible by the size of its largest native integer field.
 * - fields whose type is a multibyte integer type are aligned to their size (in bytes). For instance, an int32_t integer 
 * fieldâ€™s beginning address is always divisible by four
